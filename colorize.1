.SH NAME
colorize \- colorize text on terminal with ANSI escape sequences
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcolorize\fR [\fIoption\fR]... (\fIforeground\fR) [\fI-|file\fR]
.PP
\fBcolorize\fR [\fIoption\fR]... (\fIforeground\fR)/(\fIbackground\fR) [\fI-|file\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Colorizes text read from standard input stream or file by using ANSI
escape sequences (and also vice versa, i.e. cleaning text from sequences)
and prints resulting output to the terminal.
.PP
When colorizing text, (foreground) and eventually (background) may be either
one of following color values: none, black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta,
cyan, white, default or random.  First character of color name in upper
case denotes increased intensity, whereas for lower case colors will be of
normal intensity.  If "none" is chosen, no escape sequences will be emitted.
.PP
Color escape sequences are added per each line, hence colored lines can be
safely extracted.
.PP
When de-colorizing text, \-\-clean omits color escape sequences which
were emitted by colorize (see NOTES for list), whereas \-\-clean\-all
omits all valid ones.  If in doubt, consider using \-\-clean\-all.

.SH FILES
.TP
.B ~/.colorize.conf
user configuration file
.PP
.RS
If the aforementioned file exists, it is read, parsed and processed
prior to handling the command-line options.  Command-line options
override configuration values, but are currently not capable of
unsetting them.  If unsetting is desired, comment them out or remove
them.

.B Syntax
.RS
Each line ought to start with a name of an option, followed by = and
an optional value.  Leaving the value blank, unsets the option.
.PP
Whitespace is allowed before the option name, after the option name,
before the option value and after the option value.
.PP
Comments may be placed before or after the option is set.  Everything
following the '#' sign is treated as being commented out.
