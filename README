colorize
========

Description
-----------
Colorize aims at being a small, independent and handy command-line
text colorizing tool.  It emits ANSI escape sequences in order to
color lines of text; also, sequences emitted by colorize or foreign
programs may be cleared.

The main code is written in C (c89 mostly), whereas the test script
consists of Perl code.

Colorize is known to build and test successfully on Linux and
Net/Open/MirBSD.  Other platforms are untested, so be prepared for
it to eventually not work as expected there.

Requirements
------------
gcc
make
perl

Build instructions
------------------
Issue `make' to build colorize.

Once completed, run the tests with `make check'.

Then you should most likely have a working binary.  There are
currently no make targets to install it as such.

Finally, remove it through `make clean'.

Documentation
-------------
See man page source file: colorize.1.

Afterword

Let me know, if you have ideas, bug reports, patches, etc.
