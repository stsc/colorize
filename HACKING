colorize Hacking
================

Git dependency for version output
---------------------------------
The colorize sources ought to be made available as a Git repository,
otherwise no detailed git version hash may be included in the version
output of colorize.  Even versions of older commits will no longer be
accessible.  See version.pl for some in depth code.
